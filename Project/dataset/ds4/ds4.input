China’s economic growth continues to moderate, in 2014 gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 7.4 
percent, within the government’s indicative growth target of about 7.5 percent for the year, but sharply 
slower than the 10 percent annual growth rate China averaged for three consecutive decades. An orderly 
correction  in  real  estate—reflecting  policy  efforts  to  reduce  supply  mismatches  and  tighten  nonbank 
credit—continues to weigh  on economic activity. Ongoing adjustments in real estate, a buildup of excess 
capacity, and decelerating export growth are affecting industrial activity.  In contrast  growth in services 
remained robust as composition of growth continues to improve.
China’s  growth slowdown is not unexpected and is desirable from short-  and medium-term perspectives. 
In the short term, it reflects policies to slow rapid credit growth, contain shadow banking, limit borrowing 
by local governments, and reduce excess capacity in industry. These policies  address  the  vulnerabilities 
that built up after  the 2008 global financial crisis. Over the medium term,  lower  growth is consistent with 
a gradual shift in China’s growth model, from manufacturing to services, from investment to consumption, 
and from exports to domestic spending.
The  growth  of  aggregate  financing  (stock)—a  broad  measure  of  outstanding  credit—continues  to 
decelerate. This trend reflected government moves to tighten  regulations on  trust and interbank assets
and to check corporate and government credit demand, as well as investors’ greater awareness of risks in 
nonbank products. Issuance of new debt to finance new projects is falling as the authorities introduced
guidelines on management of local government debt. This policy tightening has been partially offset by a 
series of targeted and limited stimulus measures to prevent growth from slowing too much. 
Balancing reforms  and short-term demand management  remains  a priority in 2015 as  large-scale, broadbased stimulus measures aimed at supporting short-term growth may conflict with efforts to increase the 
sustainability  of  medium-term  growth.  Efforts  to  cut  excess  capacity  in  heavy  industry,  dampen 
unproductive  risk  taking  in  shadow  banking,  and  harden  budget  constraints  on  local  governments  will 
help  make  investment  more  efficient  and  realign  growth  over  the  medium  term.  In  the  short  term, 
however, such reforms will depress activity. Official targets for 2015 signal a downward trajectory, with 
GDP targeted at about 7 percent, half a percentage point lower than in 2014. 
A  narrowly  targeted  stimulus  may  mitigate  the  tradeoff,  but  will  also  be  harder  to  implement.  The 
projected gradual deceleration assumes a firm commitment to pushing through structural reforms and to 
reducing  vulnerabilities;  at  the  same  time,  targeted  stimulus  is  expected  to  attenuate  the  impact  on 
short-term growth, should this show signs of slowing to much below the government’s indicative target 
of about 7 percent.
Growth in China is expected to decelerate to 7.1 percent in 2015 and to 6.9 percent by 2017. Progress in 
rebalancing  the  sources  of  growth  in  domestic  demand  will  remain  incremental.  An  increase  in  labor 
share in GDP is critical to rebalance growth on the demand side from investment  to consumption.  While 
annual data suggest that household income and wage shares in GDP have started to rise, reversing a twodecade trend, a transition to more equitable growth will be gradual.
Deleveraging  the economy while maintaining growth requires a better allocation of credit, which in turn 
requires financial sector reforms.  China has tempered the pace of total credit growth, though leverage is 
still building up. China’s financial system was developed to serve the old investment-driven growth model, 
effective  during  earlier  phases  but  less  so  now.  So,  reforms  should  enable  the  financial  system  to 
reallocate credit to those sectors that can maintain reasonable growth over the medium-term.
